## Top 10 Airports With the Most Planes Flown From in 2017

```{sql}
SELECT a.origin, 
	COUNT(a.flight) AS flight_count, airports.name

LEFT JOIN airports ON airports.faa = a.origin
WHERE year = 2017 OR year = 2016

Flight 2666 headed to LAX in 8th of December, 2017. The flight's arrival was delayed for 61 minutes and then arrived 30 minutes late with Skywest Airlines (OO).

This is the same flight (#2666) going back to SWO.

##The Top
According to the data, the Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport (ATL), located in Atlanta, Georgia, has the most airplanes flown to and from it.
![The ATL from the Sky](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d9/Atlanta_Airport_Aerial_Angle_%2831435634003%29_%282%29.jpg)
An international airport review^[https://www.internationalairportreview.com/article/32311/top-20-largest-airports-world-passenger-number/] states that the ATL has been the busiest airport worldwide since 1997 (with the exception of the year 2014 where it came in second place). In 2017, this airport maintained its position of first place with almost 104 million passengers. In 2018, it was still number one in terms of passenger count with a 3.3% increase compared to the previous year.

###There Must Be a Reason for This Trend?
A BBC Article^[http://www.bbc.com/travel/story/20130207-why-is-atlanta-the-worlds-busiest-airport] explains that one of the main reasons as to why the ATL has kept its place in the top of the rankings is because Atlanta, Georgia is the home of the world’s largest airlines, Delta Air Lines, which had the record for the most annual air traffic until 2012. Another reason is the location of the airport. Atlanta is located within a “two-hour flight of 80% of the US population.” Therefore, the city is a major paint of entry and an ideal stop for connection flights in and out of the country. ATL is the only airport in Atlanta. Unlike ATL, the other major points of entry, such as New York, contain multiple airports so air traffic is split between them. In addition to this, ATL is also the biggest airport in Georgia, so it can better support the number of flights to and from the airport.

In 2011, Atlanta was ranked seventh in the most visited city for business travel in the US. This is not surprising, considering that Atlanta is the home of many large companies such as Coca-Cola, Home Depot, UPS, and Delta Air Lines. Many of the big companies also host tours for all kinds of visitors. Non-business travelers would most likely be interested in Atlanta’s Georgia Aquarium, which is one of the largest aquariums in the world. All of this makes Atlanta a popular place visit, which would increase the number of people using the ATL.

##The Bottom
In 2017, the Stillwater Regional Airport (SWO), located in Payne County, Oklahoma, was the airport with the least number of flights having flown to or from it. That year, only one flight flew to SWO and only one flight flew from SWO. Since both flights had the same flight number, the data proves that these flights are actually the same.

###The History
After World War II, SWO was one of the six places in the nation that stored surplus military aircraft. Starting from 1945, about 475 airplanes were flown in. Central Airlines DC-3s landed in SWO from 1953 to 1968 when Central Airlines merged with Frontier Airlines. In 1980s, several commuter airlines, including Metro Airlines, used this airport. After several years with no airline flights, Envoy Air, the largest air carrier for American Airlines, started flying Embraer-145s to Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport in August 2016. In 2015, SWO had 79,819 aircraft operations, with an average of 219 per day. These operations consisted of 94% general aviation, 4% military, 2% air taxi, and less than 1% airline. Thus, although airline activity is scarce, the airport is still busy each day. SWO is also home to The Oklahoma State Flight Center. It “trains students majoring or minoring in Aerospace Administration and Operations with a concentration in professional pilot” - wikipedia^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stillwater_Regional_Airport]. This may be why there was only one airline flight in 2017.

###Fun Fact
The SWO is home to the Stillwater Airport Memorial Museum.

###The Impact
According to a 2017 Economic Impact Study conducted by the Oklahoma Aeronautics Commission^[https://www.growstillwater.org/page/home/site-selection/unique-assets/stillwater-regional-airport], Stillwater’s airport has a local economic impact of more than $70 million annually and either directly or indirectly contributes to 663 jobs in the community. Since 2016, SWO has been offering multiple daily arrivals and departures to American Airlines’ largest hub, Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport. SWO is also undergoing construction and expansions of its terminals and taxiways.

###The Award
In 2017, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) awarded SWO with its Oklahoma Regional Airport of the Year Award. The Stillwater news press^[https://www.stwnewspress.com/news/faa-names-stillwater-regional-as-oklahoma-airport-of-the-year/article_38a46574-8213-5cc5-8f09-23f728e20b2c.html], in their article, state that this award “recognizes airport sponsors that have creative a positive safety culture, implemented sound and consistent capital planning, supported FAA initiatives and have enhanced safety at the airport.” Apparently, SWO has been on an upward trajectory in terms of recognition ever since commercial flights with American Airlines began (which would be in August 2016). In response to the award, Airport Assistant Director Paul Priegel said, “We’re consistently the fourth busiest airport in terms of operations, which are landing and takeoff, we’re around 80,000 landings and takeoffs per year. A lot of people don’t realize that.” Airport Director Gary Johnson added, “Our economic impact for 2016 was $70 million to the local economy. That’s direct and indirect as well as jobs and the multiplier effect of the dollars.”

###An Interesting Find
It seems like the small number of airline flights at SWO does not diminish the airport’s importance to the community nor to the state. According to the data we analysed, SWO should be the airport with the least airplane activity, especially since there was only one airline flight recorded in the database. On the contrary, SWO won an award from the FAA. This airport also has a lot of historical significance and is essential for its support of its surrounding economy. The SWO airport was just one bit of data in our database, and yet, once we take a closer look, there is so much more beneath the surface. This really brings home the saying, "don't judge a book by its cover." But in our case, don't judge an airport by its airline flight records!!
